# Exquisite Chronicle
* We are developing a writing app where based off of the idea of Exquisite Corpse, a collaborative story chronicle that traces its roots to the Parisian Surrealist Movement.

* Exquisite Corpse is written by several people, each of whom writes a word on a sheet of paper, folds the paper to conceal it, and passes it on to the next person for his or her contribution.

* Weâ€™d like to incorporate that group story writing idea into our app. A user writes a prompt for other users to view. Those users can then add chapters to the prompt, creating a collaborative story telling experience.

## User Interactions
* From the index view, users can view completed stories by genre. 	

* After logging in, a user can create a prompt by genre or view prompts by genre; e.g. such as horror, mystery, adventure, love story etc.

* Users can select a prompt, rendering a view to the last chapter submitted under that prompt.

* A form would allow a user to add a new chapter to that prompt. API calls would append the chapter to the prompt in the database.

* Each prompt has a max number of chapters, and each chapter a max number of characters.

## Technologies Used
* React for user interface

* Express with NodeJS to make AJAX calls with custom routes defined.

* Sequelize ORM on a PostgreSQL database.


# MVP
* Create a working website for **Exquisite Chronicle**.
* Guest users can view completed stories by genre.
* After logging in, a user can create a prompt by genre or view prompts by genre.
* All forms: login, register and create a prompt fully functional.
* Create all necessary routes using React and Express.      
* Style all components using CSS.

# POST-MVP
* Spell checking functionality.
* Check user age and determine appropriated content.
* A Log Out feature.
* Use a third-party API (https://market.mashape.com/montanaflynn/spellcheck) for spell checking functionality.

# Project Board

# Other Organizational Tools
[Documentation and Style Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kHvEwJpPA6yf3gPer59Aw6etE7lAc6EXt0n34_Vt7m4/edit)

We decided during the initial stages of preparation to create documentation and a style guide so that there would be consistent naming conventions across all of our work. We also had a wrap up at the end of each day where we AirPlayed and went through all the code worked on for that day.

# Issues and Resolutions
* ESLint errors

* Passing props from child component to parent component. Instead of passing down state to a child component, the parent can pass down a callback function. This callback function then is run through some interaction with the child component. The purpose of this callback function is to change a piece of the state that is a part of the parent component.

Child component
```
handleGenreChange = () => {
    let genre = this.state.value;
    this.props.setGenre(genre);
}
```
Parent Component
```
handleGenre = (genreValue) => {
  this.setState(prevState =>({
    formData: {
      ...prevState.formData,
      genre:genreValue
    }
  }));
}
<Dropdown
  setGenre={this.handleGenre}
/>
```
