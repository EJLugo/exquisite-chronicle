# Exquisite Chronicle
* We are developing a writing app where based off of the idea of Exquisite Corpse, a collaborative story chronicle that traces its roots to the Parisian Surrealist Movement.

* Exquisite Corpse is written by several people, each of whom writes a word on a sheet of paper, folds the paper to conceal it, and passes it on to the next person for his or her contribution.

* Weâ€™d like to incorporate that group story writing idea into our app. A user writes a prompt for other users to view. Those users can then add chapters to the prompt, creating a collaborative story telling experience.

## User Interactions
* From the index view, users can view completed stories by genre. 	

* After logging in, a user can create a prompt by genre or view prompts by genre; e.g. such as horror, mystery, adventure, love story etc.

* Users can select a prompt, rendering a view to the last chapter submitted under that prompt.

* A form would allow a user to add a new chapter to that prompt. API calls would append the chapter to the prompt in the database.

* Each prompt has a max number of chapters, and each chapter a max number of characters.

## Technologies Used
* React for user interface

* Express with NodeJS to make AJAX calls with custom routes defined.

* Sequelize ORM on a PostgreSQL database.

* Third party APIs: https://market.mashape.com/montanaflynn/spellcheck for spell checking functionality.
