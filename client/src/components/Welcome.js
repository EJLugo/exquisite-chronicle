    <p>We are developing a writing app where based off of the idea of Exquisite Corpse,
       a collaborative story chronicle that traces its roots to the Parisian Surrealist
       Movement.</p>
    <p>Exquisite Corpse is written by several people, each of whom writes a word on a
       sheet of paper, folds the paper to conceal it, and passes it on to the next person
       for his or her contribution.</p>
    <p>Weâ€™d like to incorporate that group story writing idea into our app. A user writes
       a prompt for other users to view. Those users can then add chapters to the prompt,
      creating a collaborative story telling experience.</p>
